## Self Service Kiosk (McDonald's Clone)

This project is a clone of a McDonald's kiosk built with ReactJS and its hooks. The goal of creating this project was to learn and gain experience with a new technology, specifically React and its hooks. The project allows users to order food items and customize their order, just like at a real McDonald's kiosk.

The project was created with the latest version of React and uses functional components with hooks for state management. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, making it easy for users to navigate and place their orders.

Created as final project for TFN classes on V SEM PJAIT
